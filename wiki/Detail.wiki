#summary Configuration detail
----
= Common configuration =
Common configuration between PPM Sum and standard receiver (_see [HowTo build] part for wiring_).


== DJI Naza GPS ==

_*If you need to display the following things :*_

 * Number of satellites
 * GPS Fix
 * Satellite HDOP information (GPS quality signal)
 * Home distance
 * Absolute Altitude or Altitude above Home
 * Ground speed
 * Home direction (accurate information only when copter is moving)

You have to connect the DJI Naza GPS to the *pin 8* of the Arduino. 

You have two options to get GPS Naza data :

 # [uBloxSolder Solder] a wire directely on the GPS Naza
 # Build an [NazaConnector adapter] to directely get GPS Naza information, and keep Naza GPS connected to Naza Main Controller 


== DJI Naza gimbal output ==

_*If you need to display an artificial horizon*_

If you don't use any gimbal connected to your DJI Naza, and you want to display an artificial horizon, you can then use the gimbal output of DJI Naza for this.
 * Gimbal Roll  (Pin 4) : For roll artificial horizon information
 * Gimbal Pitch (Pin 5) : For pitch artificial horizon information

You may have to adjust the gimbal gain of your DJI Naza, to have a proper display. 

For exemple you can set _pitch gain to 12 and roll gain to 8_


== Current Sensor ==

_*If you need to display the following things :*_

 * Instant current consumption
 * Real battery remaining 

Connect current sensor to pin A3, if you want to display current information.

* !!! Please notice, that current sensor output should not be above 5V*

If you're flying with a [http://team-blacksheep.com TBS Discovery Frame] you can use the current sensor coming in standard with this frame.
The parameter configuration is
{{{
#define CURRENT_FACTOR             2.05  
}}}


== Voltage Sensor ==

_*If you need to display the following things :*_

 * Battery voltage
 * Estimate battery remaining 

Connect voltage sensor to pin A0, if you want to display voltage information. 

If you don't have any voltage sensor, you can build it with resistors ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider Voltage divider]) or you can use a cheap one, for exemple the !FrSky Battery Voltage Sensor.

* !!! Please notice, that voltage information should not be above than 5V*

== RSSI ==

RSSI information can be displayed from an analog source or a PWM source (like !FrSky receiver)

If your RSSI source is analog then connect it to PIN A2 (_*be careful this source shouldn't provide voltage above 5V*_), if it's numerical connect it to PIN 12.

Numerical RSSI signal output can be modified if you want it more linear (see the RSSI [Parameter parameter])



----
= Specific configuration =

If you need to display the following things :

 * Flight mode (ATTI / GPS / ACRO / FAILSAFE)
 * Throttle percent
 * Flight time


== Standard receiver ==

Connect receiver throttle wire to PIN 2 (Throttle percent / Flight time) and flight mode wire (normally this information come from receiver channel 5) to PIN 7


== PPM receiver ==

Connect receiver PPM wire to PIN 2


_*Please note that PIN assignment can't be change for Standard receiver or PPM receiver.*_
