#summary FrSky telemetry description
----
=== !FrSky telemetry ===
You can send telemetry data to your !FrSky receiver, and then receive those informations to your Taranis radio or your FLD_02 screen

Uncomment this, if you wish to send !FrSky telemetry information (of course only working with !FrSky telemtry module)
{{{
#define FRSKY_PROTOCOL
}}}

You can either display GPS information (for Taranis) in DMS (48°N52'13.782) or NMEA (48°52.1378N) information. Default is NMEA
{{{
//#define FRSKY_DMS
}}}

If your Taranis radio is displayed information in Imperials units, you should uncomment this line. Default is Metrics  
{{{
//#define FRSKY_IMPERIALS
}}}

Uncomment if FLD_02 is used (leave commented for TARANIS)
{{{
//#define FRSKY_FLD02
}}}

== Send telemetry data ==

To send telemetry data, you have to connect arduino Pin 9 to RX pin of your !FrSky telemetry receiver.
This was tested with Receiver D8R-XP and D8R-II plus, but it should work with any telemtry receiver.
