#summary How-to build your own BagaOSD
----
= Introduction =

There are several steps to build your BagaOSD :
 * Make your communication cable
 * Solder a wire on DJI Naza GPS
 * Solder every cables needed on Arduino
 * Upload Arduino code
 * Upload MinimOSD code and configuration
 * Test everything is working
 * Make a "compact" OSD with Shrink Tube and foam

= How to connect Arduino and MinimOSD =

Just glue 2 male to male servo lead together. You need a +5V wire (red), a ground wire (black) an one wire for communication (white), you can remove the other wire you don't need.
See picture below for the result of the connection cable

= How to get DJI Naza GPS information =

You have unscrew the Naza GPS to open it (be careful not to lose any screw), after you can solder a wire on the second pin to get the GPS serial information.

= How to prepare your Arduino board =

There's 2 differents configuration, one using standard receiver configuration, the other one using receiver that output PPM.
All the configuration is done in a single file "config.h". Of course you can change all the default values and the default PIN number assignment, except receiver PIN assignment


== Standard receiver configuration ==
|| *PIN* || *Function* || 
|| 2 || Throttle || 
|| 4 || Gimbal roll for horizon display || 
|| 5 || Gimbal pitch for horizon display || 
|| 6 || Yaw (not used) || 
|| 7 || FMode (Flight mode : Acro / Atti / Gps / Failsafe) - Flight Mode ||

== PPM Sum receiver configuration ==
|| *PIN* || *Function* || 
|| 2 || PPM Sum signal from receiver || 
|| 4 || Gimbal roll for horizon display (it's not a PPM Sum signal)|| 
|| 5 || Gimbal pitch for horizon display (it's not a PPM Sum signal)||

== RSSI Configuration ==
|| *PIN* || *Function* || 
|| A2 || Analog RSSI (_#define RSSI_PIN_ANALOG_) || 
|| 12 || PWM RSSI    (_#define RSSI_PIN_PWM_)|| 


== Sensor ==
|| *PIN* || *Function* || 
|| A0 || Voltage sensor (_#define VOLTAGE_PIN_) || 
|| A3 || Current sensor (_#define CURRENT_PIN_)|| 
|| RX || GPS||
